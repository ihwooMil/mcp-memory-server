# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Sentence-level memory splitting** — Multi-sentence turns are split into individual sentences, each evaluated and saved independently with its own category and keywords
  - `split_sentences()` splits on sentence-ending punctuation and Korean 종결어미+comma
  - Both real-time (`auto_search`) and batch (sleep cycle) extraction use sentence splitting
  - Example: "저는 Python 개발자입니다. 김치찌개를 좋아합니다." → `[technical]` + `[preference]`

### Changed

- `HeuristicMemoryExtractor.evaluate()` minimum content length lowered from 20 to 5 chars (Korean text carries high info density per character)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Automatic conversation logging** — All conversation turns are recorded to a SQLite append-only log (`conversation_log.db`) with WAL mode for concurrent safety
- **Dual-saving in `auto_search`** — Every turn is logged to SQLite for batch processing, and high-value turns (matching personal/preference/tech/emotion patterns) are instantly extracted to ChromaDB
- **Memory extraction pipeline** — New `extraction.py` module with three extractors:
  - `HeuristicMemoryExtractor` — Pattern-matching based (reuses `extract_keywords()` / `classify_category()`)
  - `RLMemoryExtractor` — MLP bandit for EXTRACT/SKIP binary decisions with imitation learning
  - `ProgressiveExtraction` — Manages transition: `heuristic_only` → `rl_assisted` → `rl_primary`
- **Sleep cycle extraction task** (Task 0) — Batch-processes unprocessed conversation logs to catch memories missed by real-time heuristics, with deduplication (similarity ≥ 0.90)
- **Sleep cycle log cleanup** (Task 5) — Deletes processed logs older than 30 days (configurable)
- **Auto category classification** — `memory_save` default category changed to `"auto"`, which auto-classifies content using pattern matching
- **`extraction_source` metadata** — Tracks how each memory was created: `"heuristic"`, `"rl"`, `"auto"`, or `""` (manual)
- **6 new extraction config options** in `SleepCycleConfig`: `enable_memory_extraction`, `extraction_max_turns`, `extraction_dedup_threshold`, `extraction_min_info_density`, `extraction_rl_confidence_threshold`, `log_retention_days`

### Changed

- `SleepCycleRunner` now accepts optional `conversation_log` parameter
- `SleepCycleReport` includes `extraction` and `log_cleanup_deleted` fields
- `MemoryNode` includes `extraction_source` field
- `GraphMemoryStore.add_memory()` accepts `extraction_source` parameter

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- **Project renamed** from `mcp-memory-server` to `long-term-memory`. Python import name (`aimemory`) and CLI commands unchanged.
- **GitHub repository** renamed to `long-term-memory` (old URL auto-redirects)

### Added

- **Auto-linking** — New memories automatically link to similar existing ones (similarity ≥ 0.92) via bidirectional graph edges
- **Live graph visualization** (`aimemory-live`) — Real-time WebSocket-based memory graph in the browser
  - Force-directed layout (vis.js ForceAtlas2) with category-based coloring
  - Glow effects on save (green) and search (blue)
  - Event log sidebar with hover-to-highlight related nodes
  - Persistent event history across browser refreshes
  - Cross-process event push (MCP → live server via WebSocket `/event` path)
- **`memory_visualize` tool** — Generate interactive static HTML graph (13th MCP tool)
- **`[live]` optional dependency** — `websockets>=12.0`

### Deprecated

- PyPI package `mcp-memory-server` — use `long-term-memory` instead

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-28

First public release.

### Added

- **MCP Server** with 12 tools: `auto_search`, `memory_save`, `memory_search`, `memory_update`, `memory_delete`, `memory_get_related`, `memory_pin`, `memory_unpin`, `memory_stats`, `sleep_cycle_run`, `policy_status`, `policy_decide`
- **RL Memory Policy** — Rule-based importance scoring + MLP contextual bandit (SAVE/SKIP/RETRIEVE)
- **Enhanced Policy** (opt-in) — 778d state encoder (SentenceTransformer 768d + 10d hand-crafted), experience replay buffer, progressive autonomy
- **Semantic Search** — ChromaDB vector store with `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` embeddings
- **Knowledge Graph** — NetworkX-based entity-relation graph with multi-hop traversal
- **GraphRAG Hybrid Retrieval** (opt-in) — Vector similarity + graph traversal with RL re-ranker (11d features)
- **Multi-Resolution Text** — 3 levels (full text, keyword summary, entity triples) with token-budget-aware composition
- **Forgetting Pipeline** — Decay-based aging with compress → deactivate → delete stages
- **Sleep Cycle** — Periodic maintenance: consolidation, resolution regeneration, forgetting, checkpoint saving
- **Immutable Memories** — Protected from modification/deletion with SHA-256 rule hash verification
- **Pin/Unpin** — User-controlled forgetting protection
- **Multilingual Support** — Korean (ko) and English (en) i18n patterns
- **P2P Federated Learning** — Gossip protocol with differential privacy and Krum aggregation
- **A/B Comparison Framework** — Baseline vs re-ranked retrieval comparison
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions with Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 matrix
- **611 tests** passing across 31 test files

### Removed

- Deprecated DualHeadDQN offline training pipeline (replaced by online MLP bandit)
- `ExtractorConfig` (unused after DQN removal)
